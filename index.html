                <h2> What is the Sacrament of Marriage? </h2>
                <p> Rooted in the Christian faith, the Sacrament of Marriage is a sacred vocation placed by God in the hearts of two people who freely choose to walk life’s journey together in love and faith. It is a covenant of lifelong unity under God and His Church, a promise to live not only for one another but for the Lord Himself, endlessly mirroring His steadfast grace in all that they are and all that they do.</p>

        <p>As Matthew 19:6 proclaims, “So they are no longer two, but one flesh.” With the truth it bestows, the couple is entrusted with embodying the communion of God’s image in one another. No longer is there only an “I,” but a “we,” strengthened by God’s abiding grace to withstand life’s inevitable trials and to grow together in a fruitful union with Him.</p>
        <p>On the next page, we are invited into the journey of a married couple as they embrace the Sacrament of Marriage. Marked by the joys, challenges, and lessons along the way, their story inspires us through the faithful commitment and sacrifices it takes to nurture a relationship and to walk together as living witnesses of God’s love and faith.</p>
