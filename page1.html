      <h3>Mr. & Mrs. Nagtalon</h3>
      <p>
        Mr. and Mrs. Nagtalon believe marriage is about choosing the right partner, building trust, and keeping faith at the center of the relationship. In their six years together, they’ve learned patience, open communication, and the value of sharing both responsibilities and laughter. For them, a lasting marriage thrives on trust, humor, and never losing the childlike joy in each other.

      <h2> Insights </h2>
      <ol> 
        <li> God entrusted them to take care of each other for the rest of their lives. That is what gives them the strength to keep the bond strong and stay willingly for one another.  </li>
        <li> Matrimony emphasizes commitment to one another and to God, reminding us that no man is an island when going through life, its joys and its challenges, as a married couple </li>
        <li> How you trust, love, and understand your partner comes from how you love the Lord. He, too, is in your promise and your marriage; he guides and directs you in how you can understand and reconcile with your partner. </li>
        <li> You go into the sacrament of matrimony, not for you to have a wedding, but for the reminder of the partnership that you have to build for the future that you see with each other. </li>
        <li> Because marriage is a union, there is no longer “I” but “we,” and in times of hardship, couples must learn to communicate, set aside differences, and embrace each other rather than isolate themselves. </li>
      </ol>
