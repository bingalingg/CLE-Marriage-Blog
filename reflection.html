                <td> Mia <br> <br> The interview with Mr. and Mrs. Nagtalon reinforced my views about marriage in such a way that my perspective of how marriage is has changed. They taught me to look at marriage as a three-way relationship with the Lord. The grace of this sacrament helped the couple overcome their challenges by remembering the promises that they made, not just the promises they made to each other, but to the Lord. Remembering this while also remembering that the Lord loves each of them, they got through their challenges. They believe that the Lord loves them, so if the Lord loves them, they should uphold their promise to love and care for each other as well. I think the lessons learned from this interview can help aspiring young couples by guiding them in understanding the reasons for marriage, its importance, and its significance in one’s life. It would help them change their views of how they should see and treat marriage. It’s a total partnership with someone you chose to be with forever. It would help them understand marriage, it’s a lifelong commitment that requires patience, communication, and a willingness to grow together through all of life's challenges and joys.</td>

From the interview, you would know that they’ve experienced Married life as one, including God in their relationship. They were transparent and honest about the realities of marriage and I believe that made them authentic and all the more in touch with each other. Overall, the interview displayed the importance of finding a partner that you can trust and depend and someone that ensures that God is at the center of any relationship. Young couples who may encounter this interview should utilize what Mrs. and Mr. Nagtalon have shared to work toward a marriage that is secure, selfless, and with God. </td>

                <td> Andie <br> <br> Mr. And Mrs. Nagtalon's relationship really encompasses patience, security, trust and understanding. Throughout the interview, how they express and tell their experiences, really shows how one can grow in love and in God when you build this partnership with the right person you want to share a life with, a view of marriage that I admire most. Moreover, because they give emphasis in having a God-centered relationship, through all the hardship they faced, they were able to go through it because they stayed true to their vows, and their promise to God to learn how to love him, and through him each other. From this interview, young couples will definitely feel the assurance and security of the path they will be taking together, through understanding and trusting their relationship to the Lord.</td>
                <td> Amari <br> <br> Mrs and Mr. Nagtalon's personal experiences with the sacrament of matrimony reinforce my belief that marriage is a beautiful thing that takes two people who love and cherish each other to make it work. Despite the chaotic society we live in now, if two people actively work together, marriage can still be a truly healthy and life-fulfilling aspect of our lives. The grace of the sacrament of matrimony can help overcome marital issues by grounding the relationship in God. Through this practice, we are reminded that marriage is intended to be a long-term or even lifelong relationship that requires our best efforts, for in marriage, we are bound not only by love but also by the Lord. Moreover, the lessons imparted by the couple that younger people can use are finding ways to ensure that both parties have the same or similar values and morals while working towards a common ground and goal. </td>
                <td> Lawran <br> <br> From the perspective of someone who loves the idea of love, matrimony, and marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Nagtalon gave me a deeper understanding of what truly happens within married life. I especially liked how Mrs. Nagtalon explained the example of a pyramid, where her priorities are rearranged, placing God first, her husband second, and then her family after him. The grace of the Sacrament of Matrimony helped the couple overcome many challenges by keeping their faith strong and supporting each other throughout the years. From this interview, I learned valuable lessons. First, I need to always set my priorities straight and never be swayed by temptation. Second, I must learn to be more understanding and accept that a healthy and stable marriage requires countless sacrifices. With these lessons in mind, I believe this interview can greatly help young couples who aspire to be married, as it provides a meaningful perspective from those already living out the sacrament.</td>

                <td> Gianna <br> <br> Interviewing Mr. and Mrs. Nagtalon was truly mind-opening and heart-warming. Throughout the conversation, it became clear that they were not just each other’s spouse, but also best friends in life. Their relationship reflected a strong sense of teamwork and balance, making every aspect of their marriage and dynamic appear deeply healthy and fulfilling. Their marriage  was very Christ-centered; from the way they spoke to each other and about one another, you can tell how much love, security, dedication, and genuine care are shared in their relationship. With this, they made me more open and enlightened on the idea of centering one’s relationship around the Lord. In facing difficulties in their marriage, one of my favorite lines was how they reminded each other that the Lord entrusted them to one another, which meant that even in difficult times, they had a responsibility to take care of and remain faithful to each other. Furthermore, one of their strongest reminders was to focus on the marriage, not just the wedding, and to know yourself before entering a relationship. These insights, grounded in faith and self-awareness, can help young couples establish a healthy and lasting foundation in their relationships, one that is rooted in love, trust, and Christ at the center, like theirs is.</td>

                <td> Sofia <br> <br> From the interview with Mr, and Mrs. Nagtalon, I learned that in marriage, it is important to have God at the center of a relationship. In addition to strengthening the connection between two people, a faith-centered marriage allows them to remain obedient to God by continuing to listen and to love him. I also realized that marriage is about working and growing together with your partner, supporting one another through both good and bad times.</td>
